# FiM Queueing: User Documentation

## An opening disclaimer

The currently deployed version of this application is only intended for use by FIRST in Michigan events by authorized users. If you are interested in your own version, deploy your own copy or open an issue in this repo for a discussion on expanding the use.

## Getting Started

Before you arrive at the event, you should receive a message on Slack either to your personal account or to the account assigned to the AV computer. This message will include a link to the queueing display and your unique event key. The key will become active on the day stated in the message, and it will not work after the event is scheduled to end. If you need your key to be active for longer due to extenuating circumstances, reach out.

Hook up your queueing computer to the provided TV or whatever you're using to display queueing and pit information. Navigate to the given URL and enter your provided event key. If the schedule has not yet been released, the display will reflect this. Once the schedule has been posted, the display should automatically update within one minute. Once the display is up, be sure to scroll the page down so that the event name is no longer visible. This will dedicate the entire height of the window to queueing information.

Once match play starts, the queueing display will update on its own as scores are posted for matches. If for some reason scores are not automatically advancing, the display can be put into "assisted mode". Once in queueing mode, the left and right arrow keys can be used to change the match currently on the field. This can be changed on any computer and it will immediately update all queueing displays.

## Troubleshooting

### Something is weird and I don't know why

## Support
